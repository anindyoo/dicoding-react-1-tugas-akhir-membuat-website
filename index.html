          <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
          <p>The conception & recording stories of COWBOY CARTER lie here.</p>
          <section id="conception">
            <h3>CONCEPTION</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Houston, Texas, the city of cowboy, country and zydeco music, Beyoncé often indulged herself with the culture along with her family since she was just a little child. As a child, Beyoncé used to listen to country music with her grandfather and attended Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo every year.</p>
            <p>With a vivacious knowledge of the country music that she had since her childhood days, Beyoncé took a chance to create her first original country music Daddy Lessons on her <em>Lemonade</em> album in 2016. To celebrate her hometown culture even further, she performed the song at the 50th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 2, 2016. The performance was well praised and gave the association its highest viewership in history. However, this uplifting celebration was precipitously started to cease as horrid comments kept coming from the conservatives & racists. In December 2016, The Recording Academy's country music committee rejected Daddy Lessons, the first country song Beyoncé ever released, marked as for not being country enough.</p>
            <p>The unwelcoming outcomes in the 2016 didn't break Beyoncé's soul. She kept experimenting and reinventing this beloved music genre of her. She delved into the history of country music and Western culture and researched its African-American roots. She studied our rich musical archive and learned from educators who had long advocated for a re-education on the black roots of country music. She also read that, historically, half of cowboys were black, which made her realize how much of the Black, brown and Native cowboy stories are missing in American history.</p>
            <p>Once the inspiration was found & conceptualized, Beyoncé conceived COWBOY CARTER as a journey through a reinvention of Americana, in which she redefines its boundaries and spotlights overlooked contributions of African-Americans to diverse musical genres, Southern and Western culture, and American history.</p>
            <p>COWBOY CARTER is the second act of Beyoncé's planned trilogy albums, a trilogy that created as a celebration of musical genres that once were belonged and originated by the black community, which serves the continuation from the first act, <em>Renaissance</em> (2022), a house & dance album.</p>

            <h3>RECORDING</h3>
            <p>COWBOY CARTER was recorded first in 2019, and concluded in 2024. The album was mainly recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic and originally intended as the first act of the trilogy. However, due to the pandemic, Beyoncé revised the plan and released the house & dance album, <em>Renaissance</em>. She stated that the album was a proper comeback to bring back the lost light & joy during the quarantine era.</p>
            <p>Beyoncé recorded around 100 songs for the album. Each song is its own reimagined version of a Western film.</p>
            <p>While COWBOY CARTER is generally described as a country and Americana album, the album blends together various styles of music that Beyoncé listened to when growing up in Texas, including blues, folk, zydeco, rock and roll, psychedelic soul, rhythm and blues, funk, gospel, bluegrass, opera, rock, honky-tonk and go-go. The album also fuses in more contemporary and international musical styles, such as hip hop, pop, house, Jersey club, flamenco, funk carioca, fado and Irish folk.Beyoncé's experimentation with musical styles on COWBOY CARTER aims to break down the limitations placed on genre-based music, in the service of redefining the boundaries of Americana.</p>
